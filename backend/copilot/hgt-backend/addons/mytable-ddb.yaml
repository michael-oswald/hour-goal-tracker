# You can use any of these parameters to create conditions or mappings in your template.
Parameters:
  App:
    Type: String
    Description: Your application's name.
  Env:
    Type: String
    Description: The environment name your service, job, or workflow is being deployed to.
  Name:
    Type: String
    Description: The name of the service, job, or workflow being deployed.

Resources:
  # Create your resource here, such as an AWS::DynamoDB::Table:
  # MyTable:
  #   Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
  #   Properties:
  #     ...

  # 1. In addition to your resource, if you need to access the resource from your ECS task
  # then you need to create an AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy that holds the permissions for your resource.
  #
  # For example, below is a sample policy for MyTable:
  MyTableAccessPolicy:
    Type: AWS::IAM::ManagedPolicy
    Properties:
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Sid: DDBActions
            Effect: Allow
            Action:
              - dynamodb:BatchGet*
              - dynamodb:DescribeStream
              - dynamodb:DescribeTable
              - dynamodb:Get*
              - dynamodb:Query
              - dynamodb:Scan
              - dynamodb:BatchWrite*
              - dynamodb:Create*
              - dynamodb:Delete*
              - dynamodb:Update*
              - dynamodb:PutItem
            Resource: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:<AWS-ACCOUNT>:table/hour-goal-tracker

Outputs:
  # 1. You need to output the IAM ManagedPolicy so that Copilot can add it as a managed policy to your ECS task role.
  MyTableAccessPolicyArn:
    Description: "The ARN of the ManagedPolicy to attach to the task role."
    Value: !Ref MyTableAccessPolicy

  # 2. If you want to inject a property of your resource as an environment variable to your ECS task,
  # then you need to define an output for it.
  #
  # For example, the output MyTableName will be injected in capital snake case, MY_TABLE_NAME, to your task.
